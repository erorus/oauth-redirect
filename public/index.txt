OAuth Redirect Bounce
---------------------

App developers can use this domain as an OAuth callback redirect URL for custom schemes.

For example, an Authorization Server may require the callback redirect URL to start with
    https://
but your mobile app requires a custom scheme, such as
    foo://bar/baz

In that case, you can set your callback redirect URL to:
    https://oauth.click/foo/bar/baz
That will redirect to:
    foo://bar/baz

Note: we do not support "http" nor "https" for custom schemes,
since you should use your own server with https in that case.
